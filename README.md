## Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```

From your command line, first clone this repo:

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sayande2002/youtube_clone_reactjs

# Go into the repository
$ cd youtube_clone_reactjs

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server.

### 📌 WARNING
If the app does not load anything or the search function doesn't work, it is very likely the daily YouTube API quota has exceeded. There are only 5000 daily quotas for free usage, and each search costs 100 quotas.
